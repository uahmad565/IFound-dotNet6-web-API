The aim of our project is to make a system that will help in connecting the people who find 
some missing people or object and the people who got their person or object missing. 
Moreover, the system will use face recognition and object recognition to find missing people 
and things easily and in less time.
Introduction
It is very difficult and time consuming to find missing children, disabled people and dead 
bodies. Missing children if not found by their guardian, can be a serious threat to the society. 
They lack education and guidance, there is high risk that they will be involved in criminal 
activities. Similarly, there is no system to reach the owners of any missing dead body. In 
addition, it is also very difficult and time consuming to find any missing things.
In the United States, 521,705 children were reported missing in 2021 [1]. Over 70,000 children 
are reported missing each year in the UK [2]. Similarly, there are many missing cases in other 
countries. 1,271 children were reported missing in Pakistan in 2021 [3].
